# ACDriver Implementation Analysis Report

## Overview
ACDriver is a deep learning-based self-driving algorithm for Assetto Corsa. The project consists of two versions (v1 and v2) with different approaches to computer vision and control systems.

## Project Structure

### Version 1 (v1/)
- **Apps/**: Contains TestApp.py - a basic Assetto Corsa plugin template
- **Utilities/**: Core implementation files including screen capture, neural network training, and data processing

### Version 2 (v2/)
- **screencapture.py**: Improved screen capture using mss library

## Implementation Analysis

### Data Collection System (v1)

#### ScreenCapture.py
**Status**: Partially Implemented

- Saves training data as numpy arrays

**Key Features**:
- Real-time screen capture at 800x640 resolution
- Edge detection preprocessing
- Training data collection with telemetry labels
- Automatic data saving every 16,000 samples

**Limitations**:
- Hardcoded file paths for Windows
- Basic image preprocessing only
- No error handling for missing log files
- Limited to specific screen resolution

#### testscreencap.py

### Neural Network Implementation (v1)

#### kerascnn.py
**Status**: Functional but Basic
**Architecture**:
```
Input: (60, 80, 1) grayscale images
Conv2D(32, 3x3) + ReLU
Conv2D(64, 3x3) + ReLU
MaxPooling2D(2x2)
Dropout(0.25)
Flatten()
Dense(128) + ReLU
Dropout(0.5)
Dense(3) + tanh (output: steering, throttle, brake)
```

**Training**:

4. **Cross-platform Support**: Windows-specific implementations

### ❌ Missing Components
1. **End-to-End Pipeline**: No complete system that captures → processes → predicts → controls
2. **Model Validation**: No testing of trained model in actual driving scenarios

## Technical Limitations

### Data Quality Issues
- Small training dataset (16,000 samples)
- Limited driving scenarios
- No data augmentation
- Potential overfitting due to small dataset

### Model Architecture Issues
- Basic CNN may not capture complex driving patterns

## Conclusion

ACDriver represents a solid foundation for computer vision-based autonomous driving in Assetto Corsa. The project demonstrates working components for screen capture, image processing, neural network training, and basic control. However, it lacks a complete end-to-end system and has several technical limitations that would need to be addressed for practical use.

The project appears to be in an experimental/research phase rather than a production-ready system. While the individual components work, they need significant integration and improvement to create a functional autonomous driving system.
