  - [ ] AI Opponents: 0
  - [ ] Tires: Default
  - [ ] Penalties: ON
  - [ ] Ideal conditions: ON
  - [ ] Framerate: 30 FPS
  - [ ] Controls: Gamepad
  - [ ] Speed sensitivity: 0
  - [ ] Steering speed: 100%
  - [ ] Steering gamma: 100%
  - [ ] Steering filter: 0%
  - [ ] Automatic gear switching: Enabled (Ctrl+G)

### Network & Communication

- [ ] **System resources** monitored
- [ ] **SSD** available for faster data access
- [ ] **GPU** dedicated for PyTorch (if available)
- [ ] **Stable 30 FPS** maintained in Assetto Corsa

## ðŸš€ Training Start Checklist

### Before Starting Training
- [ ] **Assetto Corsa** launched and session loaded
- [ ] **Car spawned** on track
- [ ] **Automatic gear switching** enabled
- [ ] **ACRL app window** visible in AC
- [ ] **Training script** ready to run
- [ ] **Console/terminal** open for monitoring

### Training Script Execution
- [ ] **Navigate** to correct directory: `resource-repos/ACRL/standalone`
- [ ] **Run** training script: `python main.py`
- [ ] **Enter** experiment name when prompted
- [ ] **Click** "Start Training" in ACRL app window
- [ ] **Monitor** console output for errors

### Expected Initial Behavior
- [ ] **Socket connection** established successfully
- [ ] **Car begins** autonomous movement
- [ ] **Random actions** initially (exploration phase)
- [ ] **Episode counter** incrementing
- [ ] **Loss values** being logged
- [ ] **No immediate crashes** (car stays on track briefly)

## ðŸ“Š Training Monitoring Checklist

### During Training (First 100 Episodes)
- [ ] **Episode counter** increasing
- [ ] **Loss values** fluctuating (normal)
- [ ] **Car occasionally** staying on track
- [ ] **No connection errors** in console
- [ ] **AC maintaining** 30 FPS
- [ ] **System resources** stable

### During Training (Episodes 100-500)
- [ ] **Crash frequency** decreasing
- [ ] **Lap completion** becoming more common
- [ ] **Racing line** becoming more consistent
- [ ] **Loss values** trending downward
- [ ] **Episode duration** increasing

### During Training (Episodes 500+)
- [ ] **Consistent lap completion** (>80% success rate)
- [ ] **Stable racing line** following
- [ ] **Improved lap times** over baseline
- [ ] **Minimal crashes** (<10% frequency)
- [ ] **Smooth steering** and acceleration

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Checklist

### If Training Won't Start
- [ ] **ACRL plugin** properly installed
- [ ] **ACRL app** enabled in AC settings
- [ ] **Python dependencies** installed correctly
- [ ] **Correct session** loaded in AC
- [ ] **Car spawned** on track
- [ ] **Automatic gear switching** enabled

### If Connection Fails
- [ ] **Firewall** allows Python/AC communication
- [ ] **Socket ports** not blocked
- [ ] **ACRL plugin** enabled
- [ ] **Session** properly loaded
- [ ] **No antivirus** interference

### If Performance is Poor
- [ ] **AC framerate** set to 30 FPS
- [ ] **Unnecessary apps** closed
- [ ] **GPU drivers** updated
- [ ] **System resources** adequate
- [ ] **SSD** used for data access

### If Training is Unstable
- [ ] **Checkpoint files** being saved
- [ ] **Loss values** reasonable
- [ ] **Episode duration** consistent
- [ ] **No memory leaks** in system
- [ ] **Network connection** stable

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria Checklist

### After 1000 Episodes
